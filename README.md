# Collection of Jupyter Notebooks

This is just a collection of notebooks for topics that I wanted to quickly explore/visualise that may be of use to others! The intended scope was what could be done in a Friday afternoon. Time-permitting and topic-dependent, this may change.

If there is anything in the notebooks that isn't clear or have any feedback then let me know and I'll see what I can do.
