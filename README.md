# Collection of Jupyter Notebooks

This is just a collection of notebooks for topics that I wanted to quickly explore/visualise that may be of use to others! I generally intend for these to be made on a Friday afternoon, naturally limiting the scope, though as I create more I may expand this for topics I want to delve a little deeper into.

If there is anything in the notebooks that isn't clear or have any feedback then let me know and I'll see what I can do.
